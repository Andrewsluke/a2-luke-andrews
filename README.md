RESOURCES USED:

Bootstrap - Most styling was modified, but utilized general look and feeling for most components. The bootstrap grid
            system is also super useful and used throughout the site.

Angular Tutorial - Prior to this assignment I didn't know Angular at all, therefore I used the following tutorial;
		   https://angular.io/tutorial. This was mostly used in understanding the passing of data 
		   using Angular.
